References

Use of different and many literature sources for reference in applicable documents enabled checking and validating if the broad literature points to the same conclusions about the studied sports performance facts/theories. This also avoided reference use only because of algorithmic and availability biases. 

Because multiple sources point to the same basic information, the references used are strong and support the literature review, research question, metric selection, and range and threshold selection.
