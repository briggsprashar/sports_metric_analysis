4.2 Research Synthesis & Recommendations

|Synthesis Section|Response|
|---|---|
|**1. Introduction**|| 
|1.1 Research question| What are the most important metrics for Rate of Force Development (RFD) and Movement-Efficiency & Gait-Complexity (ME&GC), and how do female and male athletes perform in these metrics? <br /> <sub>For additional details click [here.](https://github.com/SBU-Sports-Metrics/507_groupproject_2025/blob/main/Project.md#research-question)<sub> |
|1.2 Why it matters?| The research question helps explores sports performance metrics through an established theoretical framework/ constructs (RFD and ME&GC) sourced from current sports performance literature rather than randomly selected metrics or line of inquiry based on an incomplete and small data sample. <br /> <br />RFD and ME&GC are key determinants of performance in court-based sports. RFD measures the neuromuscular system’s capacity to generate force rapidly, which is critical for explosive actions such as jumping and sprinting. ME&GC assesses the efficiency with which athletes convert force into movement over extended periods, encompassing locomotor quality, workload, and gait complexity. There is limited understanding of how these two systems interact wth some key metrics and differ between women’s and men’s teams when assessed longitudinally during actual training and competition cycles.<br /> <br /> From a cleaned and transformed aggregated sports athlete data, selected metrics and basketball related data was extracted for statistical analysis to potentially help the SBU athletics department get some external feedback on their data. The objective was to determine which metrics most effectively represent RFD and ME&GC and to characterize gender-based performance patterns at the team level. <br /> <sub>For more details see "Justification for why your analysis will be valuable?" section [here.](https://github.com/SBU-Sports-Metrics/507_groupproject_2025/blob/main/PDF_Reports/Part1_LitReview.pdf)<sub>|
|**2. Methods**| |
|2.1 Selected metrics|RFD-related metrics <ul><li>Peak Propulsive Power (W)</li><li>Jump Height (m)</li></ul> ME&GC-related metrics <ul><li>Speed Max (m/s)</li><li>Peak Velocity (m/s)</li><li>Distance Total (m)</li></ul><sub>For description of metrics see "Brief review of each metric section" [here.](https://github.com/SBU-Sports-Metrics/507_groupproject_2025/blob/main/PDF_Reports/Part1_Metrics.pdf)<sub>|
|2.2 Data filtering and cleaning approach | Used a structured cleaning process based on researched ranges and thresholds, removing zero/Null and NAN values before any imputation so that only valid data contribute to interpolation, summary statistics, and downstream analyses. Standardized both team labels and metric labels. Resolved naming inconsistencies. Selected the newest timestamp per player using robust `idxmax()` logic. This helped keep all steps transparent and reproducible. The end product was a clean, realistic, and fully analysis‑ready dataset that aligns with the researched information. <br /> <br />After connecting to the remote SBU athletics database and getting access to the dataset, Raw data was extracted as .csv files to clean and filter with `part1.2_preselection.py` and `part1.3_postselection.py` to get to the selected correct data cleaned as described above.<br /><br /> Click [here.](https://github.com/SBU-Sports-Metrics/507_groupproject_2025/blob/main/PDF_Reports/Part4_FlagSystem.pdf)for logic for the flag system.

|2.3 Statistical methods used| Several complementary statistical methods were used to understand player performance and identify meaningful differences. <ul><li>Player means and team means were calculated to establish baselines and compare individual athletes against their group.</li> <li>Z‑scores and percent‑difference scores (P‑scores) helped flag unusually high or low values, while linear regression was used to measure performance trends over-time</li> <li>Applied ANOVA to compare metrics between groups, using F‑statistics and p‑values to determine whether differences were statistically significant</li></ul>**Descriptive stats:** means, percentiles and z-scores. <br /> **Inferential stats:** t-tests, f-statistic, p-values, simple regression. <br /> **Visualizations:** box plots, violin plots, stacked-bar plots, line charts (reg-plots) and histograms. <br /> <sub>*Python based tools and Streamlit platform were used to put it all together.*<sub>|
|**3. Results**| |
|3.1 Key findings from your analyses| Findings that can help [operationalize thresholds](https://github.com/SBU-Sports-Metrics/507_groupproject_2025/blob/main/Project.md#operationalizing-thresholds) of the selected metrics were key. <br /> Click [here.](https://github.com/SBU-Sports-Metrics/507_groupproject_2025/blob/main/PDF_Reports/Part3_Player_analysis.pdf) for analysis of the four selected players. <br /><sub>For additional key findings and insights click [here.](https://github.com/SBU-Sports-Metrics/507_groupproject_2025/blob/main/Project.md#part-4-key-insights)<sub>|

|**4. Discussion**||
|4.1 How do your findings relate to existing literature? | 1) Female players not tested as much as the male players. <br />2) Studies on female players are a fraction of the studies on male players. <br />3) Multi-metric studies based on sprits metric constructs are much better to gain insights from than merely comparing random metrics based on volume, availability or usage.|
|4.2 What gaps did your analysis address? |1) Inconsistent thresholds across studies <br /> 2) Minimal positional subgroup analysis <br /> 3) Women’s basketball athletes are underrepresented in testing data and literature <br />4) Lack of unified frameworks that integrate multiple systems <br /> <sub>For additional details click [here.](https://github.com/SBU-Sports-Metrics/507_groupproject_2025/blob/main/Project.md#research-and-data-gaps)<sub>|
|4.3 What are the practical implications for coaches/trainers? | Composite index based multi-domain metrics clustering can help staff use to benchmark teams, target weaker squads for specific interventions (e.g., power or sprint training), and monitor whether future ANOVA tests show convergence or widening of between‑team and gender gaps. <br /> <sub>For additional details click [here.](https://github.com/SBU-Sports-Metrics/507_groupproject_2025/blob/main/Project.md#practical-applications-and-utility)<sub>|

|**5. Limitations & Future Directions**||
|5.1 Data limitations in Dataset|1) Missing or irregular testing data. <br /> 2) Gender testing biases/practices skewed data results. <br /> 3) Men not women basketball players had additional tests in summer months, potentially skewing data.  <br /> 4) Sample data was small and possibly missed some teams. <br /> <br /> <sub>For additional details click [here.](https://github.com/SBU-Sports-Metrics/507_groupproject_2025/blob/main/Project.md#limitations)<sub>|
|5.2 What additional data would be helpful? | 1) Missing data about injuries, recovery, etc can skew data <br />2) Potential data entry error or labeling errors can skew data. <br /> 3) Some data listed in Closing Remarks [here](https://github.com/SBU-Sports-Metrics/507_groupproject_2025/blob/main/Project.md#closing-remarks) would have been helpful.|
