# Teams Workspace Scripts

This folder contains our **individual coding and testing workspaces**.  
Each team member uses this area to:

- Develop and refine code independently  
- Test new features, logic, and workflows before integration  
- Experiment with ideas in a safe, isolated environment  

## Guidelines
- Keep your work organized in subfolders or with clear naming conventions.  
- Document any important changes or testing notes within your scripts.  
- Once code is stable and reviewed, migrate it to the shared repository for collaboration.  

---

**Purpose:** This folder is dedicated to personal development and testing, ensuring that collaborative code remains clean, stable, and production-ready.
